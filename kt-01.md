⭐First a ***Claim*** will be submitted with following details:

	1] Illness
	2] Procedure they took to cope with the Illness(Procedure Code)
	3] Amount


⭐For Each Illness we have "ICD" codes (Disease Code):

	1] ICD-9
	2] ICD-10

⭐These Codes are called as ***Procedure*** codes. *This code will represent the type of Illness the*
patient is getting treated for.

⭐There are another type of Codes:
	CPD Codes (Procedure Code)

⭐**2 things will received from the payers (Insurence Company):**

	1] Actual Amount
	2] Explanation for each and every *Claim*(List of ICD Codes and Procedure Code)

⭐***Remittance***:
	*It is the Explanation from the Insurance Company once they have paid the Claim or Group of Claims.*

⭐*Claim* will have all the *details*:
	
	1] Doctor's Name
	2] Disease Code
	3] Procedure Code for the Treatment Procedure

⭐*The **Claim** will be ***submitted*** by the **Hospital** and the Payment will be ***received*** by the Hospital*

⭐Claims are ***Grouped*** together and paid as a single Payment.
	We are doing it with ***Batch Processing***

⭐*Remittance* can be of 2 types:

	1] Paper
	2] ANSI-835 Electronic Format:
		Standard format for any Remittance related transaction between 2 Entities. It can be Hospital or middle man like Athena.
	3] ANSI-837:
		Used for submitting the claims.

⭐ ***Importing***

	1] We have to get the ANSI-835 Files, validate them and persist those in our Database.
	2] Each of them are submitting the ANSI-835 files differently.


⭐ **ANSI-835** *files informstion breakdown*:

	1] Always a File will start with *ISA*
	2] The file will end with *IEA*
	3] *GS* & *GR* represent groups.
	4] *BPR* represents a Batch:
			*Batch* will have a group of *Claims*.
			The *Claims* will have a group of *Charges*.
			All these are paid together.
	5] *BPR* represents an Entity of a *Payment*:
			It can be *CHK* (Cheque Payment) or *ACH* (Automated Clearing House) Payment.
	6] Threre can be multiple *BPR* (Batched) in a File.
	7] Each Batch will have a group of Charges inside them.
	8] *BPR* contains all the Claims till we get a next BPR.
	9] *CLP* represents Claim:
		Until we get another CLP (Claim), the details entered refers to the first Claim.
	10] *NM1* specifies some information about the claim:
			NM1 has *QC*, then it represents a Patient.
	11] *SVC* represents `Amount` each and every procedure for the claim that was taken.
		*SVC* represents Service Level Charges.
		SVC will contain the `Procedure Code` after '*'.
	12] *CAS* represents the `Kick Codes` with the `Kick Amount`.
	13] *PLB*:
			The `Batch` amount may not be always equal to the umber of total amounts, there can be some additional amount paid or some amount may be reduced.
			Any payment which is not specific to the number of claims will come as PLBs, which we are calling as Batch Exceptions.

			These contain `Reason Codes` like WU, L6 which are used to find out the reason.

⭐ **[SUMMARY]**

***Batch*** can have *group of **Claims [CLP]***, Each Claim will have *group of **Charges***. Other than Claims, it can also contain **Batch Exceptions [PLB]**.

***Batch*** will *start with [ISA]* and *end with [IEA]*
